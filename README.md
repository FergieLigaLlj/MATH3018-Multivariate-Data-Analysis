**Syllabus**<br>
Course Outline: This course is a basic course on multivariate statistical analysis.<br>
 We will start with a review of linear algebra and multivariate distributions. Then we<br>
 will cover inference on mean vectors, multivariate analysis of variance, principal com<br>
ponents, factor analysis, classification/discrimination, and cluster analysis. Canonical<br>
 correlation analysis will be included if time permits.<br>
 • Matrix algebra and random vectors<br>
 • Multivariate distribution<br>
 • Inference about a mean vector<br>
 • Multivariate analysis of variance<br>
 • Comparison of several multivariate means<br>
 • Principal component analysis<br>
 • Factor analysis<br>
 • Discriminant analysis<br>
 • Cluster analysis<br>
